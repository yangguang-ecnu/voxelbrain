#summary Ideas on how to deal with file structure of the porject.

= Introduction =

  * source files
  * libs
  * includes

Source files are written by me, totally and completely understood, etc.
Libraries - reusable stuff, linked or copied there from respective dependencies.
Includes - respective .h files, needed to support libs; own includes are placed in root.

Once something becomes big, it becomes a separate library... sort of.

= Details =

Problems of information organisation:

  * different ontologies.
    * header - interface of a module
    * potential candidate for includes, once it matures.
  * class names
    * finer grained usage abstraction (Buzz-Buzz-Buzz)
  * variable names
    * information on intended behaviour
    * refactoring
  * file names
    * compilation 
    * separation into library
