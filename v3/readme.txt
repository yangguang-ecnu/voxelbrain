This is the third attempt to indtill order onto my codebase;

Now, the organisation is as follows:

/
 /lib			; libraries needed to implement the interfaces used.
 /bin (optional)  	; executables might go here
 /include		; contains all the interfaces required by the codebase 
 /build 		; build instructions 
 /test			; tests
 /examples
 
Seem the same thing we have now.

Another idea:

$(GLFW)/lib
$(ATB)/lib
$(GLFW)/include

Documentation!!!

Well, ok. Try now.
