TODO:
  modules (in order of proposed implementation):
    GL interface (pretty straightforward - accepts surface points, selection points, can optionally show crossections)
    PR interface (tools for propagation; 
                  no deletion, active points are naturally those which have a possible move; 
                  move itself is an object; moves can be rated)
    UI interface (includes emitting of mouse/keyboard signals; 
                  can be implemented with different actual UI; think more)
                  
                  ----
                  
  propagation design:
    1. find possible directions given initial steps
    2. rate the directions
